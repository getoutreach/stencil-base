## HTTP P99 Latency

99.9% success rate from the "HTTP Latency High" datadog monitor, which enforces the following:

* P90 <= 2s during times of low traffic.
* P99 <= 2s during times of high traffic.

Where "low traffic" means during the last 15 minutes less than or equal to 1000 requests have
been observed.

## HTTP Success Rate

99.9% success rate on public HTTP requests where success rate is calculated as the count of
all >= 500 code responses over all responses, multiplied by 100.
