# {{ camelcase .Config.Name }} gRPC Latency High

This indicates that there are gRPC requests that are taking a long time to complete.

## Investigation

### Honeycomb

If there are a large volume of requests with high latencies some information on the details of the requests may be available in Honeycomb. Note that honeycomb samples requests (usually with a low sampling rate of 1%) so for low frequency issues the odds of finding something in Honeycomb are low.

[Navigate to Honeycomb](https://ui.honeycomb.io/outreach-a0/datasets/outreach?query=%7B%22time_range%22%3A7200%2C%22granularity%22%3A0%2C%22breakdowns%22%3A%5B%22name%22%5D%2C%22calculations%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22P95%22%2C%22column%22%3A%22duration_ms%22%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22HEATMAP%22%2C%22column%22%3A%22duration_ms%22%7D%5D%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22column%22%3A%22app.name%22%2C%22op%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22{{ .Config.Name }}%22%7D%5D%2C%22filter_combination%22%3A%22AND%22%2C%22orders%22%3A%5B%7B%22column%22%3A%22duration_ms%22%2C%22op%22%3A%22P95%22%2C%22order%22%3A%22descending%22%7D%5D%2C%22havings%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22limit%22%3A1000%7D) 
and add `deployment.namespace = {{ .Config.Name }}--<bento>` to the `WHERE` clause, where `<bento>` is the bento that
this alert fired in. These traces should provide an idea as to what could be the root cause of the latency.

### Datadog Dashboard and Logs

The {{ .Config.Name }} service has a dashboard in Datadog: https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/i6z-jcn-azh/terraform-{{ .Config.Name }}

Look for any anomalies in the dashboard.

{{ camelcase .Config.Name }} logs are available via a search: https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/livetail?query=service%3A{{ .Config.Name }}%20environment%3Aproduction%20status%3Aerror&index=main&from_ts=1652033594145&to_ts=1652206394145&live=true. Modify the search parameters to match the bento and environment the alert was generated from.

Look for signs of issues or abnormal behavior.
