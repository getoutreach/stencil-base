# stencil-base

This repository contains the base go-templates used to render a service. Currently all that is supported are Go services, which will be improved in the future. This is used to bring in all other template repositories.

## How to use this

Download [stencil](https://github.com/getoutreach/stencil).

Run it in a new directory:

```
$ mkdir my-new-service && cd my-new-service
$ stencil
```

ðŸŽ‰ You are now using these templates!
